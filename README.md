# M.Sc. Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE)
*Author: Luke Joseph Vassor*

This repository contains the source code and data to run the CMEE Miniproject submitted in candidacy of the **Taught M.Sc. CMEE course at Imperial College London**.

Project: Fitting mechanistic and phenomenological models to Thermal Performance Curves (TPCs).

![cover image](./Results/Figs/cover_image.jpg)

All code in this repository was written in and tested with `Python 3.5.2`, `R 3.2.3`, `Bash 4.3.48` and `LaTeX`.

## Directories & contents
Please do not edit directories or the directory structure as the `Bash` script relies on the structure of the workflow and so the structure must be retained exactly. Please clone entire contents for your own use instead. <br/>
All directories are formatted with the same subdirectory structure in a clean workflow, as follows:<br/>
-- `Code` contains a `Python` script `mini_project_wrangling_fitting.py` to wrangle the data from `BioTraits.csv` and fit 3 models to it and an `R` script `plotting.R` to calculate model comparison statistics and plot the model fits on the data. Lastly contains a `Bash` script to execute the project workflow and produce a pdf project report, written in `LaTeX` (see `Write-Up`).<br/>
The models included are:
* Simplified Schoolfield-Sharpe: A Schoolfield-Sharpe mechanistic model lacking a low temperature correction (1981)
* Briere: A simple phenomenological model which captures nonlinearity at high and low temperatures (1999)
* Cubic Polynomial: A mathematical polynomial function

-- `Data` houses the data which are read into the scripts in `Code`. This is the Global BioTraits Database (Dell et al., 2011). Accessible at: https://biotraits.ucla.edu/ <br/>
-- `Results` Any form of script output. The `Python` script produces a `wrangled_data.csv` file here, which is the isolated Thermal Performance Curves which have been accepted by the wrangling code. At then end of the model fitting, the `Python` scripts produces a `model_fitting_results.csv` file here, which includes all parameter estimates and model fit scores for each model on each TPC. Both of these scripts are read in to the `R` plotting script., including, but not limited to, comma-separated files and pdf plots. <br/>
-- `Write-Up` Contains `LaTeX` files used to compile the final pdf project report. In order for citations to be properly embedded into the report by `BibTex`, it is vital that the `.bib` and `.aux` files remains in this directory along with the `.tex` file, as well as the `.toc` file for the Table of Contents to render correctly. <br/>

## Known Issues
* Pandas has columns with multiple data types, this originates from the database and is not a problem. <br/>
* Y-axis labels in R can go out-of-range if longer than plot canvas height. Due to automation of hundreds of plots this could not be fixed as label was stored as variable from imported data. Could implement `if` statement to catch any known, long labels..

## Dependencies

<!-- * Note that the old materials, written in LaTeX, are now in the `archived` directory. -->

* The `Results` directory will be populated only when scripts are run, but these are not version controlled (all files in this directory under `.gitignore`).
* Please do not edit directories or the directory structure as the `Bash` script relies on the structure of the workflow and so the structure must be retained exactly. Please clone entire contents for your own use instead.
